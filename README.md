Hi, Iâ€™m @uwuanims. Iâ€™m interested in STEM fields of all sorts. Recently I've taken to learning Robotics, Python, and Linux.
Although I am frequently busy, Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on Whatever if I've got the time/resources.
If you want to reach me, you can do so through Email or most socials under my name.
